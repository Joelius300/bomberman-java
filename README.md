# bomberman

This is supposed to be a bomberman game written in java. It was a group project in school and, as you can imagine, it didn't work in the end.

I was only responsible for the [network part](https://github.com/Joelius300/bomberman-java/tree/master/src/network) (which actually works smile) but it was a requirement to use object streams (I would've probably used [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)).
